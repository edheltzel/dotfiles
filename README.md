### My personal configuration (.dotfiles) for Ô£ø macOS using üê† Fish shell.

This is my personal configuration (.dotfiles) for macOS that involves web development and devops which are deployed using [GNU Stow][STOW]. There are also files for provisioning a new machine and setting up my environment. Zach Holman wrote a nice post about how [dotfiles](https://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/) should be forked, I agree with this to a point, but I'm more of a fan of take what you like and leave the rest. Because dotfiles are highly personalized and built over time, so what works for me probably won't work for you. But take inspiration all you want and make it your own. _**So proceed with caution, and use at your own risk**_.

## Get Started

<details>
  <summary><strong>Single Line Install</strong></summary>
  I have not tested this on a fresh install, so this could break your setup. I'd suggest you read through the `bootstrap.sh` and `install.sh` scripts and the `Makefile` before running this command.

  In theory this will clone the repository and install everything outlined below. Again, In theory.
  ```shell
  bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edheltzel/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh`"
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Caveats for non-Apple Silicon (Intel)</strong></summary>
  If you are on any version of macOS that uses AFPS, you'll need to disable the SIP.
  First check to see if SIP is enabled or not.

  ```shell
  csrutil status
  ```

  output should read:

  ```shell
  System Integrity Protection status: enabled.
  ```

  If your SIP is enabled, then follow the next steps to disable it ‚Äì Assuming that you know what you're doing, here is how to turn off System Integrity Protection on your Mac.

  1. Turn off your Mac (Apple > Shut Down).
  2. Hold down Command-R and press the Power button. Keep holding Command-R until the Apple logo appears.
  3. Wait for OS X to boot into the OS X Utilities window.
  4. Choose Utilities > Terminal.
  5. Enter csrutil _disable_.
  6. Enter reboot.
  7. `csrutil status` -> should read `System Integrity Protection status: disabled.`
</details>

### üëã For future, Ed:

Since we have a bad habit of forgetting things:

1. Installing Xcode Command Line Tools `sudo softwardupdate -i -a && xcode-select --install`
    - This will install `git` and `make` if not already installed.
2. Generate a new SSH key for GitHub
    - [Generate a new ssh keys][GENSSHKEY] or restore existing key if needed.
3. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/edheltzel/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
4. Use the [`Makefile`](makefile) to install the dotfiles and packages
    - `cd ~/.dotfiles`
    - `make install`
    - Alternatively, you can run the `install.sh` script `cd ~/.dotfiles && ./install.sh`

## What's Inside

### GNU Stow

Originally I used a series of custom scripts to create symlinks, it worked but I've since switched to using [GNU Stow][STOW]. This is way more manageable and easier to understand.

### Makefile

So with the addition of Stow, I added a `makefile` ‚Äì I treat this like NPM scripts. You need to be in the root of `~/.dotfiles` to execute any of the `make` commands.

The following commands are available:

```shell
help          Show this help message (default)
install       Bootstraps a new machine
run           Symlink all dotfiles w/Stow
stow          Add individual packages w/Stow
unstow        Remove individual packages w/Stow
delete        Delete all dotfiles w/Stow
update        Sync & clean dead symlinks w/Stow
```

#### Bootstrapping

- `make install` task, it will execute the `bootstrap.sh` script. This script will install the necessary package managers, packages with dependencies, applications, clone the necessary repositories, configure the `~/.gitconfig.local` and symlink dotfiles using Stow.

#### Stowing and Unstowing

There are two options for managing packages with Stow:

1. Just use Stow: `stow nvim` or `stow -D nvim` _(unstow)_
2. Use the Makefile: `make stow pkg=nvim` or `make unstow pkg=nvim`
    - The `pkg=` variable must be specified.

## Stow Packages

- dots (dots/)
  - misc dotfiles that are stored in the $HOME directory
- git (git/)
  - git configuration
- fish (fish/)
  - XDG Base Directory ‚Äì Reference: [XDG Base Directory][XDGRef] for more information. To edit/set the XDG Base Directory variables, you can edit the `~/fish/.config/fish/conf.d/paths.fish` file. Hopefully, this will keep the `$HOME` directory clean and organized.
- nvim (nvim/)
  - When I need Vim, I use [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) - lightly customized.
- config (config/)
  - Configuration files for various applications
- local (local/)
  - User specific data not configuration related. ie: dictionaries, wallpapers, misc items that mean nothing, etc.
- warp (warp/)
  - I like Warp but I really like iTerm2
- vscode (vscode/)
  - I use the [ sync settings ][vscodeSyncSettings] feature in vscode to keep my settings and extensions in sync across platforms. The `settings.json` and `keybindings.json` are symlinked out of habit.

## Scripts

Any of the scripts can be run individually at any time to update/reset as needed.

### macOS (macos/)

`macos.sh` - Executes a long list of commands pertaining to macOS Preferences ‚Äì **DO NOT** blindly run this script - it is a WIP with each macOS update things change.

### packages (packages/)

- `packages.sh` - Installs the Brewfile and each package manager's packages based on the `.txt` files.

### repositories (repos/)

- `repos.sh` - Clones the repositories in the `` files at the corresponding locations

### private (private/)

- `private.sh` - Left empty on purpose

### duti (duti/)

- `duti.sh` - Sets the default applications for file types
    - run `./duti/duti.sh` to reset the default applications for file types

### Helper Scripts (scripts/)

- `functions.sh` - Contains helper functions for symlinked files and printing progress messages

## Troubleshooting
<details>
  <summary>Fish: Fisher Plugin Manager</summary>
  In the past, Fisher (fish plugin manager) will do something weird or will introduce a breaking change - just reinstall Fisher.

  ```bash
  curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorgebucaran/fisher/main/functions/fisher.fish | source && fisher install jorgebucaran/fisher
  ```
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Node Development</summary>
  Node Version switching for Node development, takes advantage of [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) for managing Node versions, which supports both `.nvmrc` and `.node-version` files.

  - Install happens in the `Brewfile` by running

  ```shell
  brew install fnm
  ```

  For Completions run:

  ```shell
  fnm completions --shell fish
  ```

  Make sure you run:

  ```shell
  ./fish/./setup.sh
  ```

  This will symlink the `fnm.fish` file in `~/.config/fish/conf.d` _(It might be helpful to `source ~/.config/fish/config.fish`)_

  **Note:** FNM has the ability to auto switch Node versions if there is a `.node-version` or `.nvmrc` file - this is enabled by default

  ```shell
  # automatically run fnm use
  fnm env --use-on-cd | source
  ```

  > Please note that when you change your default Node version, you will need to run `npm install --global (cat node_packages.txt)` to include `corepack` in the global packages. This will ensure that `pnpm` and `yarn` are available.

  <summary>Git: Commit and Tag Signing</summary>

  **SSH Signing**

  I use SSH commit signing over GPG. GPG is there if I need it, but I prefer SSH. For a few resources to help get this setup:

  - [Git Merge Workshop - Simplify Signing with SSH](https://github.com/git-merge-workshops/simplify-signing-with-ssh/tree/main)
  - [Gitlab SSH Commit Signing Doc](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/ssh_signed_commits/)

  The `.gitconfig` includes `.gitconfig.local`

  ```shell
    [meta]
      isLocalConfig = true
    [user]
      signingkey = PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY
    [gpg "ssh"]
      allowedSignersFile = PATH_TO_YOUR_ALLOWED_SIGNERS_FILE
  ```
  If you choose to use this make sure you look at that `./git/git.sh`, this script is where the provisioning of `.gitconfig.local` happens.
  <details>
    <summary>GPG Commit Signing - <em>optional</em></summary>

    GPG signing is set to `TRUE` by default. If you rather not enable GPG then execute: `git config --global commit.gpgsign false` and remove the GPG packages from the [Brewfile](https://github.com/edheltzel/dotfiles/blob/master/packages/Brewfile).

    [renew expired gpg](https://gist.github.com/krisleech/760213ed287ea9da85521c7c9aac1df0)

    [Generate new key and assign to global git config](https://gist.github.com/paolocarrasco/18ca8fe6e63490ae1be23e84a7039374#:~:text=It%20means%20that%20is%20not,secret%20keys%20available%20in%20GPG.)

    main take away:

    - `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long`
    - Copy key
    - set key for your git user
      - `git config --global user.signingkey <your key>`
    - If you need help setting this up GPG:
      - follow the Github article for [Signing Commits](https://help.github.com/en/articles/signing-commits) to set up you GPG key(s).
      - I found this [GIST helpful](https://gist.github.com/cezaraugusto/2c91d141ddec026753051ffcace3f1f2)
      - To get VSCode setup follow this [article](https://dev.to/devmount/signed-git-commits-in-vs-code-36do)
    - **Please Note** if you used the [Brewfile](https://github.com/edheltzel/dotfiles/blob/master/packages/Brewfile), Cask installed the macOS [GPG Suite](https://gpgtools.org/) via `cask 'gpg-suite-no-mail'` -- _(alternatively)_ update the [Brewfile](https://github.com/edheltzel/dotfiles/blob/master/packages/Brewfile) with `cask 'gpg-suite' to include GPGMail.
