# Ed's Dotfiles

### My setup for üê† Fish shell on Ô£ø macOS - `v3`

Here, you'll find my dotfiles configuration for [fish shell][fishshell] on macOS managed using [GNU Stow][STOW]. You'll also find files for provisioning a new machine and setting up my environment. Again, this is my personal setup and **changes often**, so don't blindly fork and run the [`install.sh`][installFile] script without reading it first. But get inspired, take what you want, and leave the rest to make it your own.

<details>
  <summary>Older Versions</summary>

  - [v1](https://github.com/edheltzel/dotfiles/tree/v1) uses oh-my-zsh
  - [v2](https://github.com/edheltzel/dotfiles/tree/v2) uses fish shell + custom scripts
</details>


## Prerequisites

<details>
  <summary><strong>Install with a single line...</strong></summary>

  I have not tested this on a fresh install, so this could break your setup. I'd suggest you read through the `bootstrap.sh` and `install.sh` scripts and the `Makefile` before running this command.

  In theory, this will clone the repository and install everything outlined below. Again, In theory.
  ```shell
  bash -c "`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edheltzel/dotfiles/master/bootstrap.sh`"
  ```

  <summary><em>Caveats for non-Apple Silicon (Intel)</em></summary>
  If you are on any version of macOS that uses AFPS, you'll need to disable the SIP.
  First check to see if SIP is enabled or not.

  ```shell
  csrutil status
  ```

  output should read:

  ```shell
  System Integrity Protection status: enabled.
  ```

  If your SIP is enabled, then follow the next steps to disable it ‚Äì Assuming that you know what you're doing, here is how to turn off System Integrity Protection on your Mac.

  1. Turn off your Mac (Apple > Shut Down).
  2. Hold down Command-R and press the Power button. Keep holding Command-R until the Apple logo appears.
  3. Wait for OS X to boot into the OS X Utilities window.
  4. Choose Utilities > Terminal.
  5. Enter csrutil _disable_.
  6. Enter reboot.
  7. `csrutil status` -> should read `System Integrity Protection status: disabled.`
</details>

## **üëã For future Ed**:

Since we have a bad habit of forgetting things:

1. Installing Xcode Command Line Tools
    - `sudo softwardupdate -i -a && xcode-select --install` This will install `git` and `make` if not already installed.
2. Generate a new SSH key and add to GitHub
    - [Generate a new ssh keys][GENSSHKEY]
    - `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" && ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`

3. Clone repo
    - `git clone https://github.com/edheltzel/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
4. Use the [`Makefile`](makefile) for the rest of the setup
    - `cd ~/.dotfiles && make install`
    - Alternatively, run install script `cd ~/.dotfiles && ./install.sh`
5. After the setup is complete, run `upp` to execute topgrade and update everything.
6. Optional steps for DX and nice to haves:
    - Disable Gatekeeper when installing apps: `sudo spctl --master-disable` (in macos/security.sh)
    - Make sure to run `fnm env --use-on-cd | source` to enable auto-switching of Node versions. (in fish)

## The Nitty Gritty

Originally, I used a series of custom scripts to create symlinks, and it worked, but I've since switched to using [GNU Stow][STOW]. This is way easier to manage.

So, with the addition of GNU Stow, I added a `makefile` ‚Äì I treat this like NPM scripts. You need to be in the root of `~/.dotfiles` to execute any of the `make` tasks.

The following are available:

```shell
help          Show this help message (default)
install       Bootstraps a new machine
run           Symlink all dotfiles w/Stow
stow          Add individual packages w/Stow
unstow        Remove individual packages w/Stow
delete        Delete all dotfiles w/Stow
update        Sync & clean dead symlinks w/Stow
```

**Bootstrapping**

- `make install` task, it will execute the `bootstrap.sh` script. This script, is for setting up a brand new machine, it will install the necessary package managers, packages with dependencies, applications, clone the necessary repositories, configure the `~/.gitconfig.local` and symlink dotfiles using GNU Stow.

**Stowing/Unstowing (add/remove)**

There are two options for managing packages with GNU Stow:

1. Just use Stow: `stow nvim` / `stow --restow nvim` or `stow -D nvim` _(unstow)_
2. Use the Makefile: `make stow pkg=nvim` or `make unstow pkg=nvim`
    - The `pkg=` variable must be specified.

## Stow Packages

- dots (dots/)
  - misc dotfiles that are stored in the $HOME directory
- git (git/)
  - git configuration
- fish (fish/)
  - XDG Base Directory ‚Äì Reference: [XDG Base Directory][XDGRef] for more information. To edit/set the XDG Base Directory variables, you can edit the `~/fish/.config/fish/conf.d/paths.fish` file. Hopefully, this will keep the `$HOME` directory clean and organized.
- nvim (nvim/)
  - When I need Vim, I use [LazyVim](lazyVim) - lightly customized.
- config (config/)
  - Configuration files for various applications
- local (local/)
  - User-specific data not configuration-related. ie: dictionaries, wallpapers, misc items that mean nothing, etc.
- warp (warp/)
  - Includes my [Lunar Eclipse theme](https://github.com/edheltzel/lunar-eclispe-for-terminal) and Warp preferences.
  - iTerm2 is my daily driver, I really want to like Warp, but I just can't get into it.
  - iTerm's preferences are synced with iCloud Drive.

## Scripts

Any of the scripts can be run individually at any time to update/reset as needed. ie: `cd ~/.dotfiles && ./duti/duti.sh`

- macOS (macos/)
  - `macos.sh` - Executes a long list of commands pertaining to macOS Preferences ‚Äì **DO NOT** blindly run this script - it is a WIP with each macOS update things change.
- packages (packages/)
  - `packages.sh` - Installs the Brewfile and each package manager's packages based on the `.txt` files.
- repositories (repos/)
  - `repos.sh` - Clones the repositories in the `.txt` files at the corresponding locations
- private (private/)
  - `private.sh` - Left empty on purpose
- duti (duti/)
  - `duti.sh` - Sets the default applications for file types
    - run `./duti/duti.sh` to reset the default applications for file types
- Helper Scripts (scripts/)
  - `functions.sh` - Contains helper functions for for the scripts

## Troubleshooting
<details>
  <summary>Fish: Fisher Plugin Manager</summary>
  In the past, Fisher (fish plugin manager) would do something weird or introduce a breaking change - just reinstall Fisher.

  ```bash
  curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorgebucaran/fisher/main/functions/fisher.fish | source && fisher install jorgebucaran/fisher
  ```

  <summary>Node Development: FNM</summary>

  Node Version switching for Node development, takes advantage of [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) for managing Node versions, which supports both `.nvmrc` and `.node-version` files.

  - If not already installed from the Brewfile, install `fnm`:

  ```shell
  brew install fnm
  fnm env --use-on-cd | source
  ```

  For Fish Completions run:

  ```shell
  fnm completions --shell fish
  ```

  Make sure you run:

  ```shell
  make update #updates all stow packages
  OR
  make stow pkg=fish
  ```

  Enable auto switch of Node versions with `.node-version` or `.nvmrc` files

  ```shell
  # auto runs: fnm use
  fnm env --use-on-cd | source
  ```
  Which each Node version change, enabling `corepack` is necessary to ensure that `pnpm` and `yarn` are available.

  ```shell
  npm install --global $(cat node_packages.txt)
  ```

  <summary>Git: Commit and Tag Signing</summary>

  **SSH Signing**

  I use SSH commit signing over GPG. GPG is there if I need it, but I prefer SSH. For a few resources to help get this setup:

  - [Git Merge Workshop - Simplify Signing with SSH](https://github.com/git-merge-workshops/simplify-signing-with-ssh/tree/main)
  - [Gitlab SSH Commit Signing Doc](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/ssh_signed_commits/)

  The `.gitconfig` includes `.gitconfig.local`

  ```shell
    [meta]
      isLocalConfig = true
    [user]
      signingkey = PATH_TO_YOUR_KEY
    [gpg "ssh"]
      allowedSignersFile = PATH_TO_YOUR_ALLOWED_SIGNERS_FILE
  ```
  If you choose to use this, make sure you look at that `./git/git.sh`; this script is where the provisioning of `.gitconfig.local` happens.
<details>
  <summary>GPG Commit Signing - <em>optional</em></summary>

  GPG signing is set to `TRUE` by default. If you rather not enable GPG then execute: `git config --global commit.gpgsign false` and remove the GPG packages from the [Brewfile](https://github.com/edheltzel/dotfiles/blob/master/packages/Brewfile).

  [renew expired gpg](https://gist.github.com/krisleech/760213ed287ea9da85521c7c9aac1df0)

  [Generate new key and assign to global git config](https://gist.github.com/paolocarrasco/18ca8fe6e63490ae1be23e84a7039374#:~:text=It%20means%20that%20is%20not,secret%20keys%20available%20in%20GPG.)

  main take away:

  - `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long`
  - Copy key
  - set key for your git user
    - `git config --global user.signingkey <your key>`
  - If you need help setting this up GPG:
    - follow the Github article for [Signing Commits](https://help.github.com/en/articles/signing-commits) to set up you GPG key(s).
    - I found this [GIST helpful](https://gist.github.com/cezaraugusto/2c91d141ddec026753051ffcace3f1f2)
    - To get VSCode setup follow this [article](https://dev.to/devmount/signed-git-commits-in-vs-code-36do)
  - **Please Note** if you used the [Brewfile](https://github.com/edheltzel/dotfiles/blob/master/packages/Brewfile), Cask installed the macOS [GPG Suite](https://gpgtools.org/) via `cask 'gpg-suite-no-mail'` -- _(alternatively)_ update the [Brewfile](https://github.com/edheltzel/dotfiles/blob/master/packages/Brewfile) with `cask 'gpg-suite' to include GPGMail.
