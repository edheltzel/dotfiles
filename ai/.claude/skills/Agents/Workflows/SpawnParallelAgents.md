# SpawnParallelAgents Workflow

**Launches multiple generic Intern agents for parallel grunt work (NOT custom agents).**

## When to Use

User says:
- "Launch 5 agents to research these companies"
- "Spin up agents to process this list"
- "Create agents to analyze these files" (no "custom")
- "Use interns to check these URLs"

**KEY: No "custom" keyword = generic Intern agents (same voice, fast parallel execution)**

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

| User Says | subagent_type | Voice |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| "**custom** agents" | `general-purpose` | Custom from AgentFactory |
| "agents" (no custom) | `Intern` | Same for all |

If user says "custom" → use CreateCustomAgent workflow, NOT this one!

## The Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Task List

Extract what needs to be done in parallel:
- List of companies to research
- Files to analyze
- URLs to check
- Data points to investigate

### Step 2: Create Task-Specific Prompts

**Each agent gets a DETAILED prompt with FULL CONTEXT:**

```typescript
const agent1Prompt = `
## Context
We're researching competitors in the AI security space for strategic planning.

## Current State
We have 10 companies identified. You're analyzing Company A.

## Task
1. Research Company A's recent product launches (last 6 months)
2. Identify their target market and positioning
3. Note any key partnerships or acquisitions
4. Assess their technical approach

## Success Criteria
- Specific product names and launch dates
- Clear target market definition
- List of partnerships with dates
- Technical stack/approach summary

Company A: Acme AI Security Corp
`;
```

### Step 3: Launch ALL Agents in SINGLE Message

**CRITICAL: Use ONE message with MULTIPLE Task calls for true parallel execution:**

```typescript
// Send as a SINGLE message with all Task calls:
Task({
  description: "Research Company A",
  prompt: agent1Prompt,
  subagent_type: "Intern",
  model: "haiku"  // or "sonnet" depending on complexity
})
Task({
  description: "Research Company B",
  prompt: agent2Prompt,
  subagent_type: "Intern",
  model: "haiku"
})
Task({
  description: "Research Company C",
  prompt: agent3Prompt,
  subagent_type: "Intern",
  model: "haiku"
})
// ... up to N agents
```

**All agents run simultaneously and return results together.**

### Step 4: Spotcheck Results (Mandatory)

**ALWAYS launch a spotcheck agent after parallel work completes:**

```typescript
Task({
  description: "Spotcheck parallel results",
  prompt: `Review these research results for consistency and completeness:

Company A: [results]
Company B: [results]
Company C: [results]

Check for:
1. Missing information across any companies
2. Inconsistent data formats
3. Obvious gaps or errors
4. Recommendations for follow-up research

Provide a brief assessment and any issues found.`,
  subagent_type: "Intern",
  model: "haiku"
})
```

## Model Selection

**Choose based on task complexity, not number of agents:**

| Task Type | Model | Reason |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Simple checks (URL validation, file existence, basic lookups) | `haiku` | 10-20x faster, more than sufficient |
| Standard research/analysis (company research, code review) | `sonnet` | Balanced capability and speed |
| Deep reasoning (strategic analysis, architectural decisions) | `opus` | Maximum intelligence required |

**Parallel execution especially benefits from `haiku` - spawning 10 haiku agents is both faster AND cheaper than 1 opus agent doing sequential work.**

## Example: Research 5 Companies

**User:** "Launch agents to research these 5 AI security companies"

**Execution:**
```typescript
// Single message with 5 Task calls:
Task({
  description: "Research Acme AI Security",
  prompt: "Research Acme AI Security Corp: products, market, partnerships, tech stack",
  subagent_type: "Intern",
  model: "sonnet"
})
Task({
  description: "Research Bolt Security AI",
  prompt: "Research Bolt Security AI: products, market, partnerships, tech stack",
  subagent_type: "Intern",
  model: "sonnet"
})
// ... more agents

// After results return, spotcheck:
Task({
  description: "Spotcheck company research",
  prompt: "Review these 5 company research results for consistency and gaps: [results]",
  subagent_type: "Intern",
  model: "haiku"
})
```

**Result:** 5 agents research in parallel, spotcheck validates consistency.

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: List Processing

**Input:** List of items (companies, files, URLs, people)
**Action:** Create one agent per item, identical task structure
**Model:** `haiku` for simple tasks, `sonnet` for analysis

### Pattern 2: Multi-File Analysis

**Input:** Multiple files to analyze
**Action:** One agent per file, same analysis criteria
**Model:** `sonnet` for code analysis, `haiku` for simple checks

### Pattern 3: Data Point Investigation

**Input:** Multiple data points/questions
**Action:** One agent per question, independent research
**Model:** `sonnet` for research, `haiku` for fact-checking

## Spotcheck Pattern (Mandatory)

**WHY:** Parallel agents may produce inconsistent formats, miss details, or have conflicting information.

**WHEN:** After EVERY parallel agent batch completes

**HOW:**
```typescript
Task({
  description: "Spotcheck results",
  prompt: `Review these parallel results:

[Agent 1 results]
[Agent 2 results]
[Agent N results]

Verify:
- Consistent formatting
- No missing information
- No obvious errors
- No conflicting data

Flag any issues for follow-up.`,
  subagent_type: "Intern",
  model: "haiku"  // Fast spotcheck
})
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ WRONG: Sequential execution**
```typescript
await Task({ ... }); // Agent 1 (blocks)
await Task({ ... }); // Agent 2 (waits for 1)
await Task({ ... }); // Agent 3 (waits for 2)
// Takes 3x as long!
```

**✅ RIGHT: Parallel execution**
```typescript
// Send ONE message with multiple Task calls:
Task({ ... })  // Agent 1
Task({ ... })  // Agent 2
Task({ ... })  // Agent 3
// All run simultaneously
```

**❌ WRONG: Skipping spotcheck**
```typescript
// Launch agents, get results, done
// No validation = potential inconsistencies
```

**✅ RIGHT: Always spotcheck**
```typescript
// Launch agents
// Get results
// Spotcheck for consistency
// THEN report as complete
```

**❌ WRONG: Using opus for simple parallel tasks**
```typescript
// Each agent uses opus = slow + expensive
Task({ ..., model: "opus" })
```

**✅ RIGHT: Use haiku for grunt work**
```typescript
// 10-20x faster, sufficient for simple tasks
Task({ ..., model: "haiku" })
```

## When to Use Custom Agents Instead

Use **CreateCustomAgent workflow** when:
- You need distinct personalities/perspectives
- Voice diversity matters (presenting results)
- Different analytical approaches required
- Each agent brings unique expertise

Use **SpawnParallelAgents workflow** when:
- Simple parallel processing
- Same task, different inputs
- Speed matters more than personality
- Voice diversity not needed
