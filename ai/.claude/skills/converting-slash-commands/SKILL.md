# Converting Claude Code Slash Commands to OpenCode Commands

This skill helps you convert Claude Code slash command definitions (from `.claude/commands/` or `~/.claude/commands/`) to OpenCode command format (`.opencode/command/` or `~/.config/opencode/command/`).

**Note:** When running from a personal config that symlinks to `~/.config/opencode/`, the command files will be available globally.

## Quick Reference

**Source formats:**
- Claude Code: `.claude/commands/*.md` or `~/.claude/commands/*.md`

**Target formats:**
- OpenCode Markdown: `.opencode/command/*.md` or `~/.config/opencode/command/*.md`
- OpenCode JSON: `opencode.json` config file

**Key differences:**
- Frontmatter fields: Different field names and options
- Argument syntax: Same (`$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`, `$2`, etc.)
- Shell commands: Same syntax (`!`command``)
- File references: Same syntax (`@filename`)
- New fields: `subtask`, `template` (in JSON)

## Conversion Workflow

### Step 1: Locate Source Commands

Find Claude Code slash commands to convert:

```bash
# Project-level commands
ls .claude/commands/

# User-level commands
ls ~/.claude/commands/
```

### Step 2: Read Source File

Read the command definition to understand its configuration:

```bash
cat .claude/commands/review.md
```

### Step 3: Map Configuration Fields

Convert each field from Claude Code format to OpenCode format:

**Frontmatter mapping:**

| Claude Code | OpenCode | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-------|
| `allowed-tools` | `agent` | Convert tool list to agent name |
| `argument-hint` | N/A | Not supported in OpenCode |
| `description` | `description` | Keep identical |
| `model` | `model` | Keep identical |
| `disable-model-invocation` | N/A | Not supported in OpenCode |
| N/A | `subtask` | New: Force subagent invocation |
| N/A | `template` | New: Only in JSON format |

**Tool conversion:**

Claude Code uses `allowed-tools` to restrict which tools the command can use:

```yaml
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Read
```

OpenCode uses `agent` to specify which agent runs the command:

```yaml
agent: build
```

### Step 4: Handle Special Cases

**Bash commands with allowed-tools:**

Claude Code:
```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Create a git commit
---
```

OpenCode - Use agent with appropriate permissions:
```markdown
---
description: Create a git commit
agent: build
---
```

Note: OpenCode handles tool permissions at the agent level, not command level.

**Model invocation control:**

Claude Code:
```markdown
---
disable-model-invocation: true
---
```

OpenCode doesn't have a direct equivalent. Commands are always user-invoked in OpenCode.

### Step 5: Create Target File

**Option A: Markdown format** (recommended for easy editing)

Create file at `.opencode/command/<command-name>.md`:

```markdown
---
description: Review code for quality and security
agent: build
model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
---

Review this code for:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
- Code style violations

Use !`git diff HEAD` to see current changes.
```

**Option B: JSON format** (for programmatic access)

Add to `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "command": {
    "review": {
      "description": "Review code for quality and security",
      "template": "Review this code for:\n- Security vulnerabilities\n- Performance issues\n- Code style violations\n\nUse !`git diff HEAD` to see current changes.",
      "agent": "build",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Validate Conversion

Check the converted command:

1. **Verify file location:**
   - Project command: `.opencode/command/` directory exists and file is present
   - Global command: `~/.config/opencode/command/` directory exists and file is present

2. **Verify frontmatter:**
   - Description is clear and specific
   - Agent is set appropriately (if needed)
   - Model string is valid (if specified)

3. **Verify command content:**
   - All content from original command is preserved
   - Arguments (`$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`, etc.) are preserved
   - Shell commands (`!`command``) are preserved
   - File references (`@filename`) are preserved

4. **Test the command:**
   - Use `/command-name` to invoke the command
   - Verify it behaves as expected

## Conversion Examples

For detailed step-by-step examples with before/after comparisons, see:

```bash
cat EXAMPLES.md
```

The EXAMPLES.md file includes:
- Simple code review command
- Git commit command with bash execution
- PR review with arguments
- Test runner command
- Documentation generator
- Batch conversion scripts
- Complex permission examples

**Quick example snippet:**

Claude Code format:
```yaml
---
description: Review code for quality and security
allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
---

Review this code focusing on security and performance.
```

OpenCode format:
```yaml
---
description: Review code for quality and security
agent: plan
model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
---

Review this code focusing on security and performance.
```

## Common Conversion Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Review Command

**Claude Code:**
```yaml
---
description: Review this code
allowed-tools: Read, Grep
---

Review this code for bugs and improvements.
```

**OpenCode:**
```yaml
---
description: Review this code
agent: plan
---

Review this code for bugs and improvements.
```

### Pattern 2: Git Commit Command

**Claude Code:**
```yaml
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Create a git commit
---

Current status: !`git status`
Current diff: !`git diff HEAD`

Create a commit based on these changes.
```

**OpenCode:**
```yaml
---
description: Create a git commit
agent: build
---

Current status: !`git status`
Current diff: !`git diff HEAD`

Create a commit based on these changes.
```

### Pattern 3: Command with Arguments

**Claude Code:**
```yaml
---
argument-hint: [pr-number] [priority]
description: Review pull request
---

Review PR #$1 with priority $2.
```

**OpenCode:**
```yaml
---
description: Review pull request
---

Review PR #$1 with priority $2.
```

Note: `argument-hint` is not supported in OpenCode, but the argument placeholders work the same.

### Pattern 4: Subagent Invocation

**Claude Code:**
No direct equivalent - commands run in main conversation.

**OpenCode:**
```yaml
---
description: Analyze performance
agent: plan
subtask: true
---

Analyze performance issues in this codebase.
```

The `subtask: true` forces this to run as a subagent invocation.

## Special Considerations

### Argument Hints

Claude Code supports `argument-hint` to show expected arguments:

```yaml
argument-hint: [message]
```

OpenCode doesn't have this field. Document expected arguments in the command description instead:

```yaml
description: Create git commit [message]
```

### Allowed Tools vs Agents

Claude Code controls tools at the command level with `allowed-tools`.

OpenCode controls tools at the agent level. Choose the appropriate agent for your command:

- `build` - Full access to all tools
- `plan` - Restricted tools for analysis
- Custom agents - Your defined agents

### Model Strings

Both systems use similar model strings, but ensure you use the correct provider prefix:

**Claude Code:**
```yaml
model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```

**OpenCode:**
```yaml
model: anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```

### Namespacing with Subdirectories

Both systems support organizing commands in subdirectories:

**Claude Code:**
`.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` → `/component` with description showing "(project:frontend)"

**OpenCode:**
`.opencode/command/frontend/component.md` → `/frontend/component`

Note: OpenCode includes the subdirectory in the command name, while Claude Code shows it in the description only.

### File References

Both systems use the same `@` syntax for file references:

```markdown
Review the component in @src/components/Button.tsx
```

This works identically in both systems.

### Shell Command Execution

Both systems use the same ``` !`command` ``` syntax:

```markdown
Current git status: !`git status`
```

This works identically in both systems.

### Thinking Mode

Claude Code supports extended thinking via keywords in command content.

OpenCode doesn't have a specific thinking mode configuration for commands. Extended thinking is model-dependent.

## Validation Checklist

After conversion, verify:

- [ ] File is in correct location (`.opencode/command/` or `~/.config/opencode/command/`)
- [ ] Frontmatter has `description` (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Command content is preserved exactly from original
- [ ] Argument placeholders (`$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`, etc.) are preserved
- [ ] Shell commands (``` !`command` ```) are preserved
- [ ] File references (`@filename`) are preserved
- [ ] Model string uses correct provider prefix (if specified)
- [ ] Agent is appropriate for command's needs (if specified)
- [ ] Test command invocation with `/command-name`

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Command not appearing in OpenCode
- Check file is in correct directory (`.opencode/command/` or `~/.config/opencode/command/`)
- Verify frontmatter YAML is valid (if present)
- Try restarting OpenCode

**Issue:** Arguments not working
- Verify you're using `$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`, `$2`, etc. (not `{arg1}` or other syntax)
- Check argument is being passed when invoking command

**Issue:** Shell commands not executing
- Verify syntax: ``` !`command` ``` (backticks inside the !`` `` markers)
- Check the shell command works when run manually
- Ensure agent has bash tool permissions

**Issue:** File references not working
- Verify syntax: `@path/to/file.ext`
- Check the file path is correct relative to project root

**Issue:** Model errors
- Verify model string format: `provider/model-name`
- Check provider is configured in OpenCode
- Try using `model: inherit` or omit the field

**Issue:** Command runs in wrong context
- Set `subtask: true` to force subagent invocation
- Choose appropriate `agent` for the command

## Best Practices

1. **Start simple**: Convert basic commands first to understand the process
2. **Use markdown format**: Easier to edit and maintain than JSON
3. **Choose appropriate agents**: Use `plan` for analysis, `build` for modifications
4. **Preserve command content**: Don't modify the prompt during conversion
5. **Test incrementally**: Convert one command at a time and test before converting more
6. **Document arguments**: Since `argument-hint` isn't supported, document in description
7. **Organize with subdirectories**: Keep related commands together
8. **Use project commands**: Place in `.opencode/command/` for team sharing
9. **Version control**: Commit converted commands to git for team consistency
10. **Keep it simple**: Commands should be focused and single-purpose

## Related Commands

- View commands: Check `.opencode/command/` or `~/.config/opencode/command/`
- Test command: Use `/command-name` in OpenCode TUI
- Built-in commands: `/help`, `/init`, `/undo`, `/redo`, `/share`
