## Color Usage Guidelines

### Ratios

- **Background**: 40-50% of image (dark backdrop)
- **Line Work**: 30-40% (hand-drawn elements in slate/white)
- **PAI Blue**: 15-20% (key components, primary accents)
- **Electric Cyan**: 5-10% (flows, connections)
- **Accent Purple**: 5-10% (highlights, callouts)

### Rules

1. **Dark dominates** - Background and line work make up majority
2. **Blue for structure** - Main components, boxes, important elements
3. **Cyan for flow** - Arrows, connections, data movement
4. **Purple sparingly** - Only for insights, callouts, emphasis
5. **White text always** - Never use dark text on dark background
